## Key Features & Applied Skills

* **Next.js 15** — Utilized the latest version of Next.js to build a performant React application with server-side rendering and routing.
* **React 19** — Leveraged React's modern features and hooks to create reusable, maintainable components.
* **TypeScript 5** — Implemented strong typing to improve code reliability and developer experience.
* **Tailwind CSS 4** — Styled the UI efficiently using utility-first CSS for rapid prototyping and consistent design.
* **Formik** — Managed form state and validation with ease for user inputs like login, registration, and checkout.
* **ESLint & Prettier** — Maintained code quality and consistency through linting and formatting.
* **Component Libraries** — Used `@heroicons/react` and `lucide-react` for clean, scalable SVG icons integrated into the UI.
* **Responsive Design** — Ensured the interface adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Best Practices** — Followed modern React and Next.js conventions, including folder structure, hooks, and accessibility considerations.
